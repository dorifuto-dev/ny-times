## Abstract
The purpose of this take home challenge was to test my proficiency in React, Javascript, and UX/UI fundamentals. The time limit was 8 hours and I was able to successfully meet the outlined requirements of the project as outlined below. In addtion, the project serves as practice for take home prompts that might be assigned by potential future employers as a technical challenge.
